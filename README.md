# PokiSense 1.8.8 plugin
## What is it?
Up until Minecraft 1.20 Pre-release 5, Minecraft clients had a [glitch](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-74984) that allowed them to connect to multiple servers at once.
This lets both servers interact with the client (say one enables flight, letting the client fly in the other server).<br><br>
PokiSense is a 1.8.8 plugin that replicates this glitch thanks to Lunar Client Deep Links (**lunarclient://**).
This plugin also has some cool interactions with the client.

## Warning
If not used with caution, this may get you **banned** from servers, if you end up banned, I advise you to stop having such skill issues ðŸ’€
